# Databricks Migration Tool

This is a migration package to log all Databricks resources for backup and/or migrating to another Databricks workspace.
Migration allows a Databricks organization to move resources between Databricks Workspaces,
to move between different cloud providers, or to move to different regions / accounts.

This package is based on python 3.6 and DBR 6.x+ releases.  
Python 3.7 or above is recommended if one is also exporting/importing MLflow objects.

> **Note:** This tool does not support windows currently since path resolution is different from mac / linux.  

This package also uses credentials from the 
[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dev-tools/databricks-cli.html).

## Pre-Requisites
To use this migration tool, you'll need:  
* An environment running linux with python, pip, git, and the databricks CLI installed.
* Admin access to both the old and new databricks accounts in the form of a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html).

## Setup

> Click to expand & collapse tasks
<details><summary><strong>1. Generate Tokens </strong></summary>

**Generate Access Tokens for both the old and new databricks accounts**

1. Click ![settings icon](https://docs.databricks.com/_images/user-settings-icon.png)User Settings Icon Settings in the lower left corner of your Databricks workspace
2. Click on **Access Tokens** tab
3. Click on **Generate New Token** button. ![generate token](https://docs.databricks.com/_images/generate-token.png)
4. Copy the generated token and store in a secure location.

Be sure to keep a file with the url for both the old and new databricks account
Add the old and new token and the old and new Instance ID if applicable.  You'll need easy access to all of these things when running the migration tool.
</details>
<details><summary><strong>2. Setup databricks-cli profiles</strong></summary>

**In order to run the migration tool from your linux shell**

Create a profile for the old workspace by typing:

```bash
databricks configure --token --profile oldWS
```
In this case oldWS is the profile name you'll refer to for running the migration tool `export_db.py` file within the old databricks account.

**When you use the databricks cli configure command, you'll be prompted for 2 things**

1. `Databricks Host (should begin with https://)`: When this happens, enter the old databricks workspace URL that you captured in your file above.
2. `Token`: When this happens, paste in the token you generated for the old databricks account.


Repeat the steps above for the new databricks account and change the `oldWS` profile name to something like `newWS` in order to keep track of which account you're exporting FROM and which account you're importing TO.

Create a profile for the New workspace by typing:

```bash
databricks configure --token --profile newWS
```
In this case newWS is the profile name you'll refer to for running the migration tool `import_db.py` file within the new databricks account.
</details>
<details><summary><strong>3. Install package dependencies</strong></summary>

In order to set up the python environment, clone this repository and `python3 setup.py install` from the top-level project directory.

## Import using pipeline

The recommended method of exporting and importing is by using the Pipeline contained in `migration_pipeline.py`. This pipeline performs all export and import steps sequentially, and includes checkpointing parallelization features. 

### Pipeline parameters

```

### Exporting the Workspace

To export a workspace, run:

`python3 migration_pipeline.py --profile $SRC_PROFILE --export-pipeline --use-checkpoint [--session $SESSION_ID]`

Where `$SRC_PROFILE` is the Databricks profile for the source workspace, as configured during Setup, and `$SESSION_ID` is an optional session identifier used for subsequent checkpoint runs. All data is exported to a folder named according to the `$SESSION_ID` value under the logs folder - “logs/`$SESSION_ID`”. If `$SESSION_ID` is not specified, a random value will be generated.

#### Recommended parameters and checkpointing

As a starting point, we recommend using the following parameter values:
* retry-total=30
* num-parallel=8
* retry-backoff=1.0

These can be adjusted per your scenario if needed; in general, if API limits are being hit, you can increase `retry-backoff`, decrease `num-parallel`, or both. 

If script failure occurs, you can safely rerun the same command with --use-checkpoint and --session $SESSION_ID to let the migration pick up from the previous checkpoint and rerun.

#### Updating the AWS Account ID
If your source and destination workspaces are in different accounts, you will need to update the Instance Profile ARN accordingly during the migration. To do this, run the following command after exporting the workspace assets:

```
python3 export_db.py --profile $SRC_PROFILE --use-checkpoint --old-account-id $OLD_AWS_ACCT_ID --update-account-id $NEW_AWS_ACCT_ID --set-export-dir $EXPORT_DIR/$SESSION_ID
```

Where `EXPORT_DIR/SESSION_ID` is the directory and session ID used by your export job, `SRC_PROFILE` is the profile used to export the source workspace, `OLD_AWS_ACCT_ID` is the source AWS account ID, and `NEW_AWS_ACCT_ID` is the destination AWS account ID. Note that this will only update the ARN in the Instance Profiles; the same instance profiles must still exist in the destination workspace.

### Importing the Workspace

To import into a target workspace, run:

`python3 migration_pipeline.py --profile $DST_PROFILE --import-pipeline --use-checkpoint [--session $SESSION_ID]`

The same recommended parameters as above apply in the import workflow, and similarly, if a failure occurs, `--use-checkpoint` can be used to rerun from the last checkpoint.

### Validation

Simple workspace object validation can be performed once the import is completed by first exporting the contents of the *target* workspace:

`python3 migration_pipeline.py --profile $DST_PROFILE --export-pipeline --use-checkpoint --cluster-name`

And then running the `validate_pipeline.sh` script:

`./validate_pipeline.sh $SRC_EXPORT_SESSION_ID $DST_EXPORT_SESSION_ID`

Once this completes, check the console summary, as well as the logs folder (where a new folder should be generated).

<details><summary><strong>Import using step-by-step tools (not recommended)</strong></summary>

If desired, `export_db.py` and `import_db.py` can be run in a stepwise fashion. This is the legacy mode of running the tools, and in general is not recommended. If running the scripts separately, the following order of operations applies:
1. Export users and groups 
2. Export cluster templates
3. Export notebook metadata (listing of all notebooks)
4. Export notebook content 
5. Export job templates
6. Export Hive Metastore data 
7. Export Table ACLs

By default, artifacts are stored in the `logs/` directory, and `azure_logs/` for Azure artifacts. 
This is configurable with the `--set-export-dir` flag to specify the log directory.

user and groups.  
[Instance Profiles API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/instance-profiles.html) used 
to export instance profiles that are tied to user/group entitlements.   
For AWS users, this section will log the instance profiles used for IAM access to resources. 

To export users / groups, use the following: (The profile name DEMO will be replaced with the profile you defined for your old databricks account)
```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --users
```

To import these users:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --users
```

If you plan to use this tool to export multiple workspaces, you can set the `--set-export-dir` directory to log 
artifacts into separate logging directories. 


### Clusters

The section uses the [Clusters APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/clusters.html)  

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --clusters
```
This will export the following:
1. Cluster templates + ACLs
2. Instance pool definitions
3. Cluster policies + ACLs

```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --clusters
```
<p style=color:red>If you experience errors when you try to import the clusters, it may be that you need to modify the clusters file from the logs directory to include the new instance profile if it's not the same as the one in the old databricks account.</p>

**To make changes to a cluster name to match the new databricks account**

you must edit the clusters log file after export. You do this by looking at the clusters file and identifying the old cluster instance profile which will include the old account number and the name of the instance profile.

OLD profile text from an AWS Databricks account:
`arn:aws:iam::111111111111:instance-profile/profileName`

The account number (111111111111) and profileName need to be found and replaced to migrate to the new account which may have a different account number and instance profile.

**To modify the clusters.log file run this sed operation**

```bash
sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
```

### Notebooks

This section uses the [Workspace API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/workspace.html)

This part is a 3 part process. 
1. Download all notebook locations and paths
2. Download all notebook contents for every path
3. Download all workspace ACLs

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --download
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace-acls
```

To import into a new workspace:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --workspace [--archive-missing]
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --workspace-acls 
```
If users have left your organization, their artifacts (notebooks / job templates) still exists. However, their user 
object no longer exists. During the migration, we can keep the old users notebooks into the top level 
directory `/Archive/{username}@domain.com`
Use the `--archive-missing` option to put these artifacts in the archive folder. 

**Single User Export/Import**  
The tool supports exporting single user workspaces using the following command:
```bash
# export a single users workspace
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --export-home example@foobar.com
```

The corollary is the `--import-home` option:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --import-home example@foobar.com
```
This will include notebooks, directories, and their corresponding ACLs. 

### Jobs

This section uses the [Jobs API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html)  
Job ACLs are exported and imported with this option.

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --jobs
```
If we're unable to find old cluster ids that are no longer available, we'll reset the job template 
to use a new default cluster. 

```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --jobs
```

Imported jobs into the new workspace are paused by default. We do not want to have 2 jobs run simultaneously. 
Admins must pause their jobs with Databricks defined schedules using the following option:
```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --pause-all-jobs
```

Un-pause all jobs in the new workspace:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --unpause-all-jobs
```

If you want to unpause only the jobs which were not paused in the old workspace, you can use the following option:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --import-pause-status
```

### Hive Metastore

This section uses an API to remotely run Spark commands on a cluster, this API is called 
[Execution Context](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/1.2/index.html#execution-context)

By default, this will launch a small cluster in the `data/` folder to export the Hive Metastore data. 
If you need a specific IAM role to export the metastore, use the `--cluster-name` option to connect to 
a specific cluster. 

By default, we will edit the cluster for every defined IAM role to loop through all failed exports in case the tool was 
missing IAM permissions. To disable looping through all failed exports, you can pass in `--skip-failed`

```bash
# export all metastore entries and brute force loop through all instance profiles / IAM roles
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore

# export all metastore entries on the default cluster without retries
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --skip-failed 

# export all metastore entries on a specific cluster
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --cluster-name "Test"

# export all tables within a specific database
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --cluster-name "Test" --database "my_db"
```

# import all metastore entries
```bash
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --metastore
```
To find legacy Hive tables that need to be repaired after a successful import, run the following:
```
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --get-repair-log
```
Once completed, it will upload a log to the destination location. 
Use this [repair notebook](data/repair_tables_for_migration.py) to import into the destination environment to repair 
all tables. 

### Table ACLs
The Table ACLs component includes all objects to which access is controlled using
`DENY` and `GRANT` SQL statements:
- Catalog: included if all databases are exported
  - Database: included
    - Table: included
    - View: included (they are treated like tables with ObjectType `TABLE`)
- Anonymous Function: included 
- Any File: included

Unsupported object type:
- User Function: not included yet

This section uses the API to run notebooks on a cluster to perform the export and import.
(For details, please refer to the [export table ACL notebook](data/notebooks/Export_Table_ACLs.py) 
 or the [import table ACL notebook](data/notebooks/Import_Table_ACLs.py))

By default, this will launch a small cluster in the `data/` folder with `acls` suffix to export the table ACL data. 
(This cluster needs to have table ACLs enabled, and it must be run with an admin user)

```bash
# export all table ACL entries 
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --table-acls

# export all table ACL entries within a specific database
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --table-acls --database "my_db"
```

For large workspaces it is not uncommon to encounter some ACLs that cause problems when
exporting: in such cases, a special log entry is made (marked with `ERROR_!!!`) and the export
continues. At the end error counts will be provided, and the notebooks mentioned above
contain detailed information on how to investigate any issues. Most errors are encountered
with objects that are no longer functional anyway.

### Export Groups by Name
This functionality exports group(s), their members, and corresponding notebooks.  
This assumes an empty export directory to simplify the number of operations needed.  
This does **not** include IAM roles as those likely change while moving across workspaces. 

```bash
# reset the export directory and export a set of groups
python export_db.py --reset-export && python export_db.py --profile DEMO --export-groups 'groupA,groupB'

# import the groups that were exported
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --import-groups
```

### Export / Import Top Level Notebooks
This will export all notebooks that are not a part of the `/Users/` directories to help migrate notebooks that are 
outside of personal workspace directories.  Usually, these will be notebooks in the '/Shared/' directory.

```bash
# reset the export directory and export the top level directories / notebooks
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --reset-export && python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace-top-level-only
# if ACLs are enabled, export the ACLs as well
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace-acls

# import the groups that were exported
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --workspace-top-level
# apply acls if needed 
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --workspace-acls
```

### Export / Import of Secrets
This will export secret to allow migration of secrets to a new workspace.  
There is a limit to the size of the secret value which will print an error if this fails.  
```bash
# to export you must use a cluster
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --secrets --cluster-name "my_cluster"
# to import, you do not need a cluster
python import_db.py --profile newDEMO --secrets
```

### (Alpha version) Export / Import of MLflow experiments, experiment permissions, and runs objects
Note: Registered model, model version, and metric history are not supported yet.
Please see [mlflow-export-import](https://github.com/amesar/mlflow-export-import) for standalone MLflow migrations.

This will export and import the specified MLflow objects. Because MLflow objects depend on other object types such as
workspace directories, notebooks, etc. this command should run after the other objects are successfully exported/imported.

mlflow-runs are by default only exported for the past 30 days worth of data. The user can specify other dates but should
be aware of the performance impacts.

export
```
python3 export_db.py --profile $SRC --mlflow-experiments --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4 
python3 export_db.py --profile $SRC --mlflow-experiments-permissions --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4
python3 export_db.py --profile $SRC --mlflow-runs --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4 --start-date 2022-02-26
```

import
```
python3 import_db.py --profile $DST --src-profile $SRC --mlflow-experiments --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4
python3 import_db.py --profile $DST --src-profile $SRC  --mlflow-experiments-permissions --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4 
python3 import_db.py --profile $DST --src-profile $SRC  --mlflow-runs --use-checkpoint --num-parallel 4
```
</details>

## Limitations:
**Note**: To disable ssl verification pass the flag `--no-ssl-verification`.
If still getting SSL Error add the following to your current bash shell:
```
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=""
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=""
```
* Instance profiles (AWS only): Group access to instance profiles will take precedence. If a user is added to the role 
directly, and has access via a group, only the group access will be granted during a migration.  
* Clusters: Cluster creator will be seen as the single admin user who migrated all the clusters. (Relevant for billing 
purposes)
  * Cluster creator tags cannot be updated. Added a custom tag named `OriginalCreator` with the original cluster creator
   for DBU tracking.
* Jobs: Job owners will be seen as the single admin user who migrate the job configurations. (Relevant for billing 
purposes)
  * Jobs with existing clusters that no longer exist will be reset to the default cluster type
  * Jobs with older legacy instances will fail with unsupported DBR or instance types. See release notes for the latest
   supported releases.
